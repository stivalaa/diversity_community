Version of the two-phase Schelling segregtaion plus social network formation
model from Neal & Neal (2014) allowing also multivariate "type" instead of just
two distinct types can have Axelrod style culture vector of dimenions F 
each wiht q possible traits.

This version uses mean overlap (mean of culturual similarity) with intolerance
threshold instead of fraction of identical neighbors, like the
Gracia-Lazaro et al (2009) Axelrod-Schelling model (but with Moore 
neighbourhood).
