Jens Pfau's c++ code for his Physica A paper from

http://ww2.cs.mu.oz.au/~pfauj/physicaa2012/physicaa2012-cpp.zip

modified by Alex Stivala to paralleize on MPI system using mpi4py
in conjunction with physica2012-python-mpi (modified version of Jens's 
Python scripts)

Version with relatively simple Axelrod model, but using interactinos
only in Moore neighbourhood, rather than inifinte range, and with
migration to random vacant location when overlap in neighbourhood
is less than tolerance threshold. This is the Axelrod-Schelling model
of Gracia-Lazaro et al (2009).  But also with immutable features added.

Extended to included the second ("interaction") phase of the Neal &
Neal (2014) extended Schelling model, forming a social network based
on logistic function of proximity and homophily.
